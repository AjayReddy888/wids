WIDS – Options Pricing Project
Week 1 – Python, Pandas & Stock Market Basics

In Week 1, I focused on building my foundation in Python and Pandas using the resources provided as part of the program, along with additional learning from online sources. I practiced data handling and analysis using Pandas and successfully completed the assignments given for the week. Alongside programming, I also learned the basic concepts of the stock market, which helped me understand how financial data is structured and used.

Week 2 – Data Visualization & Machine Learning Basics

In Week 2, I learned data visualization techniques using Matplotlib and Seaborn through the provided resources and online references. I also studied the fundamentals of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression, understanding both the concepts and their practical implementation. This week strengthened my ability to visualize data and apply basic machine learning models, and I completed the assigned tasks to reinforce these concepts.

Week 3 – Black-Scholes Model & Options Market

In Week 3, I focused on options pricing and the stock market in depth. I learned about the Black-Scholes equation and understood how it is used to price options. This week involved gaining deeper insights into the options market, including key parameters that affect option prices, helping me connect mathematical models with real-world financial markets.

Week 4 – Neural Networks & Final Model Submission

In Week 4, I was introduced to neural networks and learned about Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) at a basic level. Using this knowledge, I worked on the final project and built an MLP-based model (MLP1). I successfully submitted the final model to predict the strike price using the provided Asian Paints dataset, which marked the completion of the project.
